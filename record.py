"""Shared verdict-record shape for session judging.

Both the sampler (random stream) and escalate (human stream) produce this same
record — but write to SEPARATE files, because escalated verdicts are an
adversarially selected sample and must never be pooled into the random-sample
quality/savings aggregate (they would skew the scoreboard). The record carries
the generation usage the cost report needs for the counterfactual savings math.

adapter_version stamps which judge-input artifact produced the verdict:
  - "v0-blind"   : narrative-only (the adapter truncated code to 400 chars;
                   the judge never saw the code). All pre-fix verdicts.
  - "v1-sighted" : the judge received the git-diff code artifact (full files
                   with markers). Verdicts under the fixed adapter.
  - "*-tiered"   : the full packet overflowed the judge's context window, so the
                   transcript was salience-tiered to fit — all human turns + the
                   full diff + failure evidence kept, lower-salience assistant/
                   tool noise evicted. A tiered verdict saw a PARTIAL narrative
                   (though the complete human intent + code), so it must not pool
                   with a full-session verdict — it is a different, honestly
                   weaker, observation of the session.
Blind and sighted verdicts must NEVER pool in a savings/quality aggregate — a
narrative-only score and a code-aware score are not commensurable. Nor may tiered
pool with full. The cost report partitions on this field; absence (old records)
is treated as v0-blind.

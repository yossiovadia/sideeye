"""Side-Eye escalate — the HUMAN stream ("I'm not sure, ask the expensive model").

The on-demand fourth trigger: a human escalates a specific session for review by
a stronger judge. Same judge machinery as the sampler, manually triggered.

Design decisions (from the Side-Eye review):
  - REVIEW, not re-answer: the expensive model critiques; it never takes over the
    turn. A review verdict is commensurable with the sampler's verdicts.
  - Stronger judge by default (Opus 4.8): the human already paid attention, so
    the prior of a real defect is elevated and volume is human-bounded.
  - SEPARATE stream (verdicts/escalated.jsonl): escalations are adversarially
    selected and must never be pooled into the random-sample scoreboard. They are
    high-yield defect discovery + a curated hard-set for calibrating the judge.
  - A TIER knob, not just a model knob: escalation buys SELECTION, not new
    capability. Tier 1 = transcript review (default). Tier 2 = agentic
    verification (run the code) — the only thing that catches execution-dependent
    defects; not built in this POC (it's a sandboxed worker, not a script).

Env: ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.
